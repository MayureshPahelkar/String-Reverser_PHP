# String-Reverser_PHP
The String Reverser is a simple web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. This project allows users to enter any text or string into an input field and reverse it by clicking the Reverse String button.

HTML is used to create the structure of the input form where the user enters the string, while CSS is used to style the page and make the interface clean and user-friendly. PHP handles the backend logic by processing the entered string and reversing it using built-in string functions.

Once the form is submitted, the reversed string is displayed instantly on the screen, helping users clearly see the output. This project is useful for beginners to understand string manipulation, form handling, and PHP processing without using a database.

The String Reverser project is ideal for practicing basic PHP concepts and can be easily extended with additional features like case conversion or character counting.
